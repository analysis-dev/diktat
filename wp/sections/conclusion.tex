\par DiKTat is a static code analyzer that finds and fixes code style inconsistencies. DiKTat is configurable, easy-to-use and it implements CI/CD pipelines, which distinguishes it from analogues. We offer many convenient ways to use diktat in projects, so you can use it as Maven/Gradle plugin, CLI tool, Web or github actions. It supports more than 100 rules, where each of them has clear explanation and can be configured by user.
\par When the development of diKTat will finish, we are going to support rules, update frameworks and track latest kotlin language releases to keep diKTat relevant.
