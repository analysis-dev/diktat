UPDATE README

* To update the code style text in the main README, you **need to change** the contents of the file guide-chapter-n.md , the paragraph in which you added/changed the rule contained in /IdeaProjects/diktat/info/

* After the updates you **need to perform generation** using gradle `generateFullDoc` and `generateAvailableRules` contained in /IdeaProjects/diktat/info/build.gradle.kts

* You **do not need to change** the contents of the diktat-coding-convention file
